##Task1_URL shortener

###Tables of Content
1. Overview
  I have developed a simple python program that takes a long URL input and returns a shortened version of URL using the pyshorteners 
 library.

2. Requirements
   - Install the pyshorteners library using

        pip install pyshorteners

####Code Explanation
1. The code defines a function short_url(url), which uses pyshorteners.Shorteners() to shorten a long URL.
2. Runs the code using Python, and will print the shortened URL in the console.
3. The long URL is stored in url_data.
4. The code calls short_url(url_data) and prints the shortened URL.

1. Easy to share
2. Reduces Character limit Issues
3. Easier to remember & type
